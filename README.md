Advanced Todo Application is a feature-packed, essential, and advanced functionality-based task management tool.
Core features are creating a task, editing, deletion, and persistence of local storage.
Task prioritizing, search/filter bar, theme toggle, animations, and stats dashboard are its enhancements to make the application more usable and good looking.
Mobile responsiveness has been implemented and offers quite smooth performance across devices; while there is also archiving completed tasks, along with an undo feature.
The development of the app had its challenges, especially when it came to local storage synchronization, responsive design, and dynamic interactions.
Such debugging issues as date handling and event propagation required tenacity and problem-solving. 
This project was a great teacher of DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and how to integrate a number of features together. 
It underlined the importance of modular coding, iterative testing, and user-centric design.
This project also solidified my technical skills in having a more methodical approach to complex problems. 
Some features that could be developed further are real-time notifications, backend integration, and user authentication, reflecting how much more the app has room for scalability and enhancements.
